## Introduction

This repository contains the data and the python notebook for the ECSE 422 term project, a communication network designer.

## Files

The `communication_network_designer.ipynb` is the original notebook we created for the project and `input.txt` is the provided datafile containing the network configuration (number of cities, reliability of links and cost of links). In order to make it easier to run if you don't have jupyter, we also converted it to a python script (`communication_network_designer.py`). Finally, the notebook and its output is available statically as a standalone HTML page in the file `communication_network_designer.html`.
